# Analize The Movies Suscces metrics in Python

Based on my analysis of movie metrics from 1980 to 2020, it appears that there are several factors that have a strong correlation with a movie's success. 
In addition to the commonly examined factors of **"budget"** and **"box office gross"**, you have also found a strong correlation between a **"movie's score"** and the **"number of votes"** it receives. 

This suggests that audience engagement and critical reception may be key factors in a movie's success, and should be taken into account when making decisions about which movies to produce or invest in.

   + Firstly, a movie's score on websites such as Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, or Metacritic can be seen as an indicator of its critical reception. A high score indicates that a movie was well-received by professional movie critics, which can in turn influence the perception of the general public. Positive critical reviews can generate buzz and interest around a movie, and lead to more people going to see it in theaters or renting it online.

   + Secondly, the number of votes a movie receives on these websites can be seen as an indicator of audience engagement. A high number of votes indicates that a large number of people have seen the movie and have taken the time to rate it. This suggests that the movie has generated a significant level of interest and discussion among the general public, which can help to increase its exposure and popularity.

   + Overall, the strong correlation between a **movie's score** and **the number of votes** it receives suggests that critical reception and audience engagement are important factors in a movie's success. By producing movies that are well-received by both critics and audiences, filmmakers and studios can increase the chances of their movies being successful at the box office and beyond.
